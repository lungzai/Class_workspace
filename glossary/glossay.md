##ArcPy
##ArcPy is a set of tools and arguments used by ESRI in order to execute geoprocessing functions.
##It is appendable to a classic Python script, and can be used inside and outside of ArcMap.
##To access it outside of ESRI products, use the code 'import arcpy'.
##It is used, in many cases, to automate iterative analysis

##Function

##Geoprocessing
##Geoprocessing is a large variety of operations that uses input data to generate meaningful output data in ArcGIS (or other GIS softwares).
##It deals with spatial data, with a geographic coordinate system.
##An example is the use of the raster calculator/map algebra tool to generate a suitability model. For instance, to find ideal park sites, the following forumla can be used:
Population Density > x * Distance to Parks < y = Ideal Park Sites
##Loop
'''
Piece of code which you want to repeat n number of times
When you have a piece of code you want to run x number of times, then code within that code which you want to run y number of times, you use what is known as a "nested loop".
Can use functions such as "if", "elif", and "else"
##Software

##Try/Except
##Try/Except is a way to handle possible errors which the program or interface might experience. 
##It will try the user's answer to the prompt, for example, then if the users prompt is invalid it will
##handle it as an error instead of the user's input breaking the code, and forcing the code to stop running. 

#If/Else if/Else statements
